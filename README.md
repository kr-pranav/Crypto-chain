<b>Cryptochain - A crypto-currency network</b>

<i>This is just a sample project made for the purpose of learning the underlying principles of Blockchain technology.</i>

The Cryptochain project is a simple simulator of crypto-currency and blockchain. This project encompasses features like creating a wallet, conducting transactions across wallets, mining blocks and subsequent reward generation, and broadcasting the mined blocks to all the peers in the network. The technologies used to build this project are : NodeJS for Back-end and ReactJS for Front-end.

In order to get this in action, install NodeJS in your system. <br /> Then, clone this repo into the desired directory and install the dependencies mentioned in the <b>package.json</b> file using <br />&emsp;&emsp;<i>npm install</i> <br /> Start the Master Development Node using <br/>&emsp;&emsp;<i>npm run dev</i> <br/> Start the peer nodes using <br/>&emsp;&emsp;<i>npm run dev-peer</i>

To access the User Interface, open the web browser and enter http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER] <br /> [PORT_NUMBER] = 3000 (to access the Master Development Node) <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; = the port number mentioned in the command prompt where the peer-node is started (to access a peer node).
